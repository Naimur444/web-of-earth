# Web of Earth

## Overview
The Web of Earth is a fun and interactive app that helps kids understand how everything on our planet is connected. The app guides children through exciting missions, showing how small actions, like cutting down trees, can lead to bigger problems such as climate change, pollution, and disease. Players complete challenges, like defeating the “Mosquito Queen,” while planting trees and cleaning up pollution to make their virtual world healthier. Using real-world data from NASA satellites, kids can see how changes in nature affect the weather and the way people live. This is especially important as rising salinity in places like the Sundarbans is already endangering species, from tigers to crocodiles, and human activity continues to threaten forests worldwide. The app encourages real-world action by letting players take photos of themselves recycling or reporting trash, with AI helping local authorities clean up neglected areas. The Web of Earth aims to inspire kids to take care of the planet, ensuring a healthier future for both wildlife and people.
